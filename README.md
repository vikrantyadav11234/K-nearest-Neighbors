"# K-nearest-Neighbors" - with or without cross validation

**Theory of k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet effective supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It operates based on the principle that data points with similar features are likely to belong to the same class or have similar output values. KNN makes predictions by finding the k nearest neighbors to a given data point in the feature space and assigning the majority class label (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of those neighbors to the data point.

The key concepts of KNN include:

1. **Distance Metric:** KNN relies on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance, to measure the similarity between data points in the feature space. Other distance metrics, such as Manhattan distance or cosine similarity, can also be used depending on the nature of the data.

2. **k Neighbors:** The value of k is a hyperparameter that determines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. A larger value of k results in a smoother decision boundary but may lead to decreased model complexity, while a smaller value of k may lead to a more complex decision boundary but may be more prone to noise.

3. **Majority Voting (Classification) or Averaging (Regression):** For classification tasks, the class label of the majority of the k nearest neighbors is assigned to the data point. For regression tasks, the average value of the output values of the k nearest neighbors is assigned.

4. **Decision Boundary:** In classification tasks, the decision boundary between classes is determined by the distribution of data points in the feature space. KNN does not explicitly learn a decision boundary but rather classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution and does not learn explicit models. It is simple to implement, easy to understand, and suitable for datasets with low to moderate dimensions.

**Steps to Make a KNN Model:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Start by loading and preprocessing the dataset, similar to other machine learning algorithms. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Splitting the Dataset:** Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets, as with other algorithms.

3. **Model Training:** Instantiate a KNN model using a library like scikit-learn. Choose an appropriate value of k based on the nature of the problem and the dataset. Fit the model to the training data, which involves storing the feature vectors and class labels of the training instances.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression) on the testing set.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optionally, tune the hyperparameters of the KNN model to improve its performance and prevent overfitting. The main hyperparameter to tune is the value of k.

6. **Visualization (Optional):** Visualize the decision boundary of the KNN model in two dimensions to understand how it classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors. This can help in interpreting the model's behavior and identifying potential issues such as overfitting.

7. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. The predicted class labels or output values are determined based on the majority class or average value of the k nearest neighbors of each data point.
